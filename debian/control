Description: tool for computing automorphism groups and canonical labelings of graphs
 Bliss is a backtracking algorithm based on individualization and
 reﬁnement for labeling a graph.  Data structures, subroutines, and
 pruning heuristics especially for fast handling of large and sparse
 graphs are provided. This package provides the command line tool 
 bliss; a C++ and C API is also available.
